This increases precision and you may see an increase in print quality.\nThis change comes with the side effect of increased "R2D2 noise", tuned driver settings for the most used steppers have been included to combat this, but they will never be as silent in standstill as with stealthchop_threshold: 1. If you want a quieter printer refer to the "stealth mode" includes in the new printer templates, this will turn on stealthchop and limit print velocity at the cost of significantly reduced torque and precision.\nA nice consequence of this change is that it made it easier to make drivers and steppers more modular, it\'s now much easier to run high voltage steppers on some stepper slots, read more in the ',(0,r.jsx)(t.a,{href:"/docs/1.2.x/configuration/advanced-stepper-configuration",children:"Advanced Stepper Configuration"})," guide."]}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"updating-from-ratos-v10",children:"Updating from RatOS v1.0"}),"\n",(0,r.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["V1.1 is backwards compatible, but there are still a couple of things you might want to do, read more in the ",(0,r.jsx)(t.a,{href:"/changelog#updating-from-ratos-v10",children:"Update Guide"}),"."]}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"thank-you-for-your-support",children:"THANK YOU for your support"}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Thank you to everyone who donated, helped me test and suggest changes and improvements, it is much appreciated!"})]})}function c(e={}){let{wrapper:t}={...(0,i.a)(),...e.components};return t?(0,r.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,r.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}},76745:function(e,t,n){n.d(t,{Z:function(){return s}});let s=n.p+"assets/images/Type-f136b4ec26840c7a250b43b2b84fec81.png"},23663:function(e,t,n){n.d(t,{Z:function(){return o},a:function(){return a}});var s=n(75271);let r={},i=s.createContext(r);function a(e){let t=s.useContext(i);return s.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}},[t,e])}function o(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(r):e.components||r:a(e.components),s.createElement(i.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}},72228:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"permalink":"/blog/ratos-v1-1-released","editUrl":"https://github.com/Rat-OS/RatOS/edit/v2.x/site/blog/2022-01-08-ratos-v1-1-released.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-08-ratos-v1-1-released.mdx","title":"RatOS V1.1 Released!","description":"RatOS V1.1 is now released!","date":"2022-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"RatOS","permalink":"/blog/tags/rat-os"},{"inline":true,"label":"Releases","permalink":"/blog/tags/releases"}],"readingTime":1.46,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Mikkel Schmidt","title":"Creator of RatOS","url":"https://github.com/miklschmidt","imageURL":"https://github.com/miklschmidt.png","key":"miklschmidt","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"ratos-v1-1-released","title":"RatOS V1.1 Released!","authors":["miklschmidt"],"tags":["RatOS","Releases"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Moonraker is now safe to update","permalink":"/blog/moonraker-config-changes"},"nextItem":{"title":"RatOS V1.0 Released!","permalink":"/blog/ratos-v1-0-released"}}')}}]);
