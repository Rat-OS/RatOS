# RatOS 2.1 Chamber filter control

RatOS comes with a built in chamber filter control. 

## Prerequisites

To be able to use the chamber control feature you just need to configure a generic fan with the name `filter`. 
```
[fan_generic filter]
```

## Configuration

The feature is activated by default, you dont need to do anything. But you can override the settings in your printer.cfg if wanted. 
```
[gcode_macro RatOS]
variable_chamber_filter_enable: True                     # True|False = enable chamber filter control
variable_chamber_filter_speed: 1.0                       # float = chamber filter fan speed.
variable_chamber_filter_enable_at: "after_print_start"   # before_print_start|after_print_start|print_end = when to enable the filter
variable_chamber_filter_disable_period: 300              # int = disable fan after X seconds after the print ends
variable_chamber_filter_disable_bed_temp: 0              # int = wait for XÂ°C bed temp after the print ends before disabling the filter
```

## Macro hooks

To support more usecases the chamber fitler controls comes with two macro hooks that can be overwritten. 

```
[gcode_macro _CHAMBER_FILTER_TURN_ON]
gcode:
	# config
	{% set chamber_filter_speed = printer["gcode_macro RatOS"].chamber_filter_speed|default(0)|float %}

	# turn filter fan on
	SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=filter SPEED={chamber_filter_speed}
```

```
[gcode_macro _CHAMBER_FILTER_TURN_OFF]
gcode:
	# turn filter fan off
	SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=filter SPEED=0
```
