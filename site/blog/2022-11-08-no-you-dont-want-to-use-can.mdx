## No, you don't want to use CAN.

For some reason, the entire 3d printing community has convinced itself that it needs to use CAN bus connections for everything. I'm here to tell you why that's not needed with RatOS.

## What is CAN bus?

CAN bus is a brodcast like protocol in which any device can initiate a message to any other on device on the bus. It can work over longer distances and is less susceptible to noise than USB.
CAN bus also requires configuration for each device and setup. Max speed for CAN is 1Mbps and requires more overhead to work. It was developed for use in vehicles to reduce wiring.

The strengths of CAN boil down to:

-   Noise tolerance
-   Long distance
-   4 wires (power and data).

## What is USB?

USB is a point to point connection that and is used as a transport layer for many different protocols. It was made to simplify device connections to computer systems. USB is fast, has ultra low latency but works best over short distances.

The strengths of USB boil down to:

-   Plug and play
-   Low latency
-   High throughput
-   Low overhead.

## Why CAN has little benefit over USB for 3d printers running klipper.

Communication between Klippy (the klipper brain that runs on your raspberry pi) works the same between CAN and USB but with the additional overhead in setting up, CAN makes no sense.  Nobody likes additional overhead.

We have 4 USB ports (and you can add more via hubs) on a standard raspberry pi, that means you can connect a virtually unlimited amount of boards to your printer with hubs.

### But Mikkel, USB cables are so fragile?

No. Good modern USB cables are made to take years of abuse from teenagers plugging and unplugging their phone, dogs chewing on them, heck some of them can even be used to [pull cars and lift weights](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/zus-super-duty-charging-cable-lifetime-guarantee/). The bend radius that are tested are far tighter than what you'd ever use in a 3d printer. Durability is really not a concern, and even if your cable breaks, a new one is cheap and takes seconds to swap. Get a good braided USB cable and it will outlast the rest of your wiring.

### But Mikkel, USB cables are super susceptible to noise!

Also no. If you use a modern 3.1 or better spec USB cable they come with heavy shielding and have no issues operating inside your 3d printer. You're not running 10 meters of cable here, even on a V-Core 500, you won't need much more than 1.5 meters. It's a non issue.


### But Mikkel, CAN is so much more reliable!

Your control board has run on USB for ever. It's been tested and proven to work. It works just as well for toolboards too.  There is no difference in reliability.

None of the benefits CAN brings are relevant to 3d printing. You could be wasting your time trying to get it to work, when you could just plug in a USB cable and be on your way.

Stop worrying about CAN, and save yourself the headache!
